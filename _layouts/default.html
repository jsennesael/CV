        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>Here I just present a summary and some images of the things I like. For more detail, please refer to my resume below.</p>
        
        
        <h3>MSc. in Electronics and ICT Engineering Technology</h3>
        <p>This is actually still in progress. I will graduate by the end of this semester. I did already obtain the BSc. with with honors.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The images above are some of the projects I worked on. On the left you can see the class-D amplifier I built over a year ago. It was actually the first project that made me really fascinated about analog electronics. On the right you can the boost-converter that was part of our Bachelor's thesis.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Major in Digital Image Processing</h3>
        <p>In a modern world with AI and self-driving cars, image processing becomes really important. I found these courses to be really intresting and a great addition to my programming skills.</p>

        <h3>Master's Thesis</h3>
        <p>The LLC converter is a DC/DC topology widely used in the industry but not yet in space applications. The topology is usually 
          chosen for its high efficiency but the control of it is not obvious. The objective is to study the way to control the
          converter using the MSP430 microcontroller.</p>

        <h1>Hobby's</h1>
          <p>I have a lot of projects that I work on in my free time. There is much variety such as a laser CNC,
          instruments, amplifiers, sound effects, custom game/MIDI controllers and much more.
          I also like teaching people, making music and model building.
            Additionally I am an amateur brewer (beer, mead and wine).</p>
